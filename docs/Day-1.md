# Day 1 - Getting Started with Pytorch

I've decided to start the journey with `Jumping in pool` directly approach. Might be a bad decision, but I tried it the other way few months back. I signed up for [Andrew NG's Machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course, but my interested dropped as I was getting lost in the theory part. Thus I decided to take another approach of learning as you go. 

I'm starting off with dedicating 1 Hr each day to watch

Reason why I picked this up : 

- üòá Comfort - I'm already proficient in #Python, which can save me time learning another programming language.
- ü§©Popularity - Despite hearing much about TensorFlow, recent surveys indicate many are migrating to PyTorch (source: https://lnkd.in/exEiq-sd). 
- üèãüèªTrial and Error - Even if my decision is incorrect, I can always pivot and explore other options. üòõ

## Setup 
My setup is pretty clean to move forward, I might change as I go ahead, but for now what you need. 

- Good knowledge of python : If you don't know python, I'll request you to pause reading this right now, and take a python course. (Although If I were you, I'd not listed to this guy who wrote this page and still continue üòõ, and take `Jumping in pool` approach for python as well. )

Here are few places I'd recommend you to start

- Hardware setup - You don't need fancy setup at all to get started. You can start writing AI code for free on websites like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) , [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) or you can also setup things on your local, which is what I'm doing as well. I'm using a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to manage virtual env. 

Once the environment is created , I'm installing `notebook` so I can create python notebooks.

```bash
conda create -n ai pytorch

conda activate ai

pip install notebook

```

## Creating first notebook

Activate environment and start writing python code.

```python
import torch
torch.__version__
```
