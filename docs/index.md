# Learning AI in 180 Days

This is a simple journal I'm maintaining regarding my journey of a normal web developer transition to AI & ML developer. 

I'll be writing in depth about what I'm doing everyday in a separate page so anyone can follow the same journey. I might be making mistakes, picking up wrong paths, writing messy codes , but I'll make sure to document everything so you can avoid these mistakes.
